Cache-Simulator
===============
This is a Cache-Simulator created in Java to illustrate how a Cache is made.
The user can test different values on the Cache Simulator and se if the operation hit or missed.

There is a slight mod needed to be done, as we believe the cache layout is not correctly 
configured ;)
